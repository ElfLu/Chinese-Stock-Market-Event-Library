Abstract

This study investigates the effects of a revision in the price limit system on the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE). The primary finding is that the widening of price limits increased long-term volatility and reduced overall trading volume. It is shown that these adverse effects are larger for small stocks, providing a potential explanation why strict price limits are particularly popular in emerging markets.
